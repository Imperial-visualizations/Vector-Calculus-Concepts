     <center><h4>Curl Operator, $\nabla \times \mathbf{f} $</h4></center>
        Curl is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal rotation of a vector field.
        It can be seen as the tendency of rotation at a point in the vector field.
        Curl exists in circulation field such as a vortex.
        However, curl can still manifest in a  non "circulation-looking" vector field like the one on the right.
        Consider a microscopic point placed in the vector field; if the field strength acting on the point varies
        at different parts of the point, it creates a tendency for the point to rotate.
        This leads to another way of understanding curl:
        <br>
        Imagine travelling over an infinitesimal distance in the direction perpendicular to the vector field at a point.
        If the field strength changes along this infinitesimal distance travelled, there is a non-zero curl at the point.

            <li>A vector field is shown on the right. This field has a curl value as indicated.</li>
            <li>Note that the field does not look like a "circulation".
                However, as you move along a direction perpendicular to the vector field at any point,
                there is a change in the magnitude of the vector field. this gives a paddle the tendency to rotate in such a field.</li>
            <li>Adjust the slider until the value of curl is zero.
                Note that the length of the arrows in the field are constant; there is no rotational tendency, only translation.
                Hence, this is a curl-free field.</li>
