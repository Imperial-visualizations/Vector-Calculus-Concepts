     <center><h4>Introduction to Vector Calculus</h4></center>
        In vector calculus, there are three important operations that are related to $\nabla$, the vector differential operator.
        $\nabla$ can be operated on both scalar and vector fields.
        <h6>Scalar Field $\Omega( \mathbf{r} )$</h6>
            A scalar field is a function that outputs a scalar value, given $n$ independent variables in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
            It assigns a scalar value to every point in space. A nice example of a scalar field is an elevation map as seen on the right.
            The elevation value, which is a scalar value, depends on the $x$ and $y$ coordinate values on the map.
            Countour lines or colours are usually used to represent the "height" of the function value, as seen in the map.
            Some other examples of scalar fields are temperature of a room, pressure distribution in a fluid etc.
        <br>
        <h6>Vector Field $\mathbf{f}( \mathbf{r} )$</h6>
            A vector field is very similar to a scalar field, except that the function outputs a vector, given $n$ independent variables in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
            It is used to represent vectorial information.
            For example, the ocean current map on the right is an example of a vector field that depends on the $x$ and $y$ coordinates.
            At any position, the function assigns a vector that indicates the speed and direction of the ocean current.
            Other examples of vector fields are electric and magnetic fields.
        <br>
        <h6>$\nabla \Omega,$ $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f},$ $\nabla \times \mathbf{f}$</h6>
        In 3D Cartesian coordinates, $\nabla$ is given by
        $$ \nabla = \mathbf{\hat{i}} \frac {\partial}{\partial x} + \mathbf{\hat{j}} \frac {\partial}{\partial y} + \mathbf{\hat{k}} \frac {\partial}{\partial z} .$$
        $\nabla$ operates on a scalar field $\Omega$ in one way, that is:
        $$\nabla \Omega .$$
        This returns a vector field, which is the gradient field of $\Omega$.
        On the other hand, $\nabla$ can operate on a vector field $\mathbf{f}$ in two ways, namely
        $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}$$ and $$\nabla \times \mathbf{f},$$
        which give the divergence (scalar) and the curl (vector) of a vector field respectively.
        <br>
        In this visualisation suite, we will be placing our focus on the meaning of grad, divergence and curl
        instead of their mathematical derivations in the following sections,
        in order to provide a physical intuition to what $\nabla$ means, both microscopically and macroscopically.
