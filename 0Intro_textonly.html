     <center><h4>Introduction to Vector Calculus</h4></center>
        In vector calculus, there are three important operations that are related to $\nabla$, the vector differential operator.
        $\nabla$ can be operated on both scalar and vector fields.
        <h6>What is a Scalar Field? $f( \mathbf{r} )$</h6>
            A scalar field is a function that outputs a scalar value, given $n$ independent variables in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
            It assigns a scalar value to every point in space. A nice example of a scalar field is an elevation map as seen on the right.
            The elevation value, which is a scalar value, depends on the $x$ and $y$ coordinate values on the map.
            Countour lines or colours are usually used to represent the "height" of the function value, as seen in the map.
        <br>
        Imagine travelling over an infinitesimal distance in the direction perpendicular to the vector field at a point.
        If the field strength changes along this infinitesimal distance travelled, there is a non-zero curl at the point.
        <br>
        The direction of the curl vector, by convention, follows the right hand rule.
        In the field on the right, curl points out of the page when the rotational tendency is clockwise, and vice versa.
        <h6>Visualisation Guide</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>A vector field is shown on the right. This field has a curl value as indicated.</li>
            <li>Note that the field does not look like a "circulation".
                However, as you move along a direction perpendicular to the vector field at any point,
                there is a change in the magnitude of the vector field. this gives a paddle the tendency to rotate in such a field.</li>
            <li>Adjust the slider until the value of curl is zero.
                Note that the length of the arrows in the field are constant; there is no rotational tendency, only translation.
                Hence, this is a curl-free field.</li>
        </ol>
