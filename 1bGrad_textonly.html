        For a given vector field, if $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{ dl }$ is an exact differential, $\mathbf{A}$ is a conservative field. Then, $\mathbf{A}$ is the
        gradient function of some scalar function $\Omega$. That is, $\mathbf{A} = \nabla {\Omega}$.
        We can relate $\Omega$ and $\nabla \Omega$ by the equation below:
            $$ \int _A ^B \nabla \Omega \cdot \mathbf{ dl } = \Omega_B - \Omega_A$$
        From this equation above, we can see that the integral is independent of the path that one takes from A to B,
        for it is determined by only the values from the parent function $\Omega_B - \Omega_A$. This is a generalisation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

                    <li>On the right, you can see a gradient field and its scalar parent function.
                        Change the value of the parameter $a$, and observe the change in $\nabla \Omega$ and $\Omega$.</li>
                    <li>Note that as the magnitude of $a$ increases, the length of the arrows in $\nabla \Omega$ increases and the contour of the parent function
                        $\Omega$ becomes steeper as well. Hence, the gradient vector increases in magnitude as well.</li>
                    <li>All gradient fields shown in this suite are conservative. This means that the line integral along the field,
                        $\int \nabla \Omega \cdot \mathbf{ dl }$ is path independent. Move the path of the ball from Point A to Point B
                        along 2 different paths, Path 1 and Path 2.</li>
                    <li>Observe their function values. Note that along the path, the value of $\Omega$ may be different.
                        However, when the balls reach Point B, their function values are equal.</li>
                    <li>This means that the line integral $\int _A ^B \nabla \Omega \cdot \mathbf{ dl }$  is determined
                        only by the value of $\Omega$ at the limits, $\Omega_B - \Omega_A$.</li>
