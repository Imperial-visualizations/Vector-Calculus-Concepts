    <center><h4>Gradient Operator, $\nabla f$</h4></center>

    <p>
      Grad operates on a scalar field $f(x, y)$ to produce a vector field indicating the magnitude and direction of the 
      steepest gradient at each point.  It is easy to remember that grad produces a vector field, because it is necessary
      for the gradient to have a direction once there is more than one dimension involved.  It must act on a scalar field
      because it doesn't make much sense for a vector field to have a gradient.
    </p>

    <p>
      The surface shown on the right is a scalar function $f$ of two independent variables, $x$ and $y$.  Note that it is a 2D scalar field &mdash; 
      the third dimension is just being used to display the value of the function.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      Beneath it the gradient of the function $\nabla f$ is shown.  By changing the coefficient $a$, the gradient of the function can be increased
      and decreased in certain directions.  There are also several functions to choose from.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea extends to three dimensions in the same way.  For example, if you were to plot the magnitude of the Sun's gravitational field
      in 3D space around the Sun, the gradient of this field would give vectors that point to the centre of the Sun at every point.
