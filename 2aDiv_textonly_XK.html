     <center><h4>Divergence Operator, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} $</h4></center>
        Divergence is a vector operator that describes the quantity of a vector field at each point.
        It is the volume density of outward flux of a vector field at an infinitesimal volume around a point.
        This leads to another way of understanding divergence:
        <br>
        Imagine a point $(x_A,y_A)$ in the vector field, which has a vector output assigned to it.
        If $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}(x_A,y_A) \neq 0$, as we move along an
        infinitesimal distance parallel to the direction of the vector at the point (that is $\mathbf{f}(x_A,y_A))$,
        there is a change in the magnitude of the output vector, which is the field strength. If divergence is positive, the field strength
        increases as we move in the direction of the vector at $(x_A,y_A)$. If divergence is negative, the field strength
        decreases as we move in the direction of the vector at the point.

            <li>A vector field is shown on the right. This field has a constant divergence value as indicated.</li>
            <li>Note that the field does not look like a "source" or "sink".
                However, the field strength still changes along the x-direction, which indicates a non-zero divergence.
                As you move along a direction parallel to the vector field at any point,
                there is a change in the magnitude of the vector field. We can imagine this as if field lines are created or destroyed as we move along.</li>
            <li>Adjust the slider until the value of divergence is zero.
                Note that the length of the arrows in the field are constant; there is no creation or destruction of field lines.
                Hence, this is a divergence-free field.</li>
